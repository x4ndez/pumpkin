## Description

You are a gym owner that offers group training classes, and just like every established business, you need a way to communicate with your buffed up gym rats and tell them what's going on. PUMPKIN, an app with a name that makes you ask, "What does a pumpkin have to do with apps or buffed up gym rats?"... I actually do not know; but I do know that with this app, your members can:
- View the class schedule for the week, and sign in to classes.
- See their workout of the day and cry in pain as they read it.
- Access announcements saying that class is canceled because everyone at the Christmas party consumed too much alcohol (You won't announce that, but everyone knows it's true.)
