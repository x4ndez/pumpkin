## Description

You are a gym owner that offers group training classes, and just like every established business, you need a way to communicate with your buffed up gym rats and tell them what's going on. PUMPKIN, an app with a name that makes you ask, "What does a pumpkin have to do with apps or buffed up gym rats?"... I actually do not know; but I do know that with this app, your members can:
- View the class schedule for the week, and sign in to classes.
- See their workout of the day and cry in pain as they read it.
- Access announcements saying that class is canceled because everyone at the Christmas party consumed too much alcohol (You won't announce that, but everyone knows it's true.)

## Developer Comments

### 16/01/2024
This project was my first full stack application using React Native.  With just under 3 weeks, I had accomplished an MVP, and ready to present for the edX Australian Demo Day.  Starting this task I had 4 goals in mind:

1. Make an app that someone would actually use: My CrossFit coach and good friend!
2. Delve deeper into React Native.
3. Learn Typescript.
4. Use Prisma with MySQL for the back-end.  Why Prisma?  In the Monash Bootcamp, we used Sequelize to query a MySQL database; but my instructor also told me to check out Prisma so naturally I was curious, and here we are!  Prisma > Sequelize ;)

I am happy to say that I accomplished all of these tasks!  Originally it was not my goal to present this at the demo day, I just wanted an idea to play with the goals above, but a week into development I was so excited that I was writing an app that I went all in!

Another thing I would like to mention is DATES!  Specifically date manipulation and formatting.  In the past I used [day.js](https://day.js.org/) and was told the Date API in JavaScript was a mission... I chose the latter, and it was quite the mission!  But I'm also glad I did it as I now have a much better understanding of dates, formatting and date manipulation.  A part of me also likes to have full control over the formatting.  You can see my date formatting functions at './client/helpers/dateFormatting.js'.

Pumpkin was built with Expo, there is currently no .apk file.  But below in the [Deployed Application](#deployed-application) section, there is a video walkthrough provided.

As a reference, a model of the database schema is seen in the item below:
